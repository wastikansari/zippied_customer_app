          """When you use our Services, we may collect Personal Information about you. The types of Personal Information that we may collect about you are:

1(a). Information You Provide to Us Directly
You may provide your Personal Information to us when you use our Services, including when you register with Clocare, search within or place orders through our Services, contact us with inquiries, engage with our chatbot on the Site or Services, respond to surveys, or otherwise access or use our Services. This information may include:

User Profile – We collect profile information associated with your Customer Clocare account. This includes information such as name, email address, delivery address, and phone number.
Biometric Information – We may collect biometric information about you when necessary, for example from your government-issued photo identification in order to process age-restricted orders and verify your identity if you need support from us.
Order Details – When you place an order through our Services, we collect information related to that order. This may include information such as items purchased, special instructions, date, and time of order, and subtotal.
Payment Information – Payment information is collected such as bank name and payment method, or other financial information. We use a payment processor that collects your payment information and processes payments made on or through the Services. We obtain limited information about your payment card from our payment processor, such as the last four digits of your card and the expiration date.
Forms & Surveys – From time-to-time, we invite our customers and users to participate in surveys or contests. When a customer or a user participates, we request certain Personal Information such as name and email address.
1b. Information Received From You as Part of Your Communications
When you use our Services (for example on our Site), complete electronic forms, communicate with service partners or contact us, by online chat, email, phone or text, we may automatically collect and store certain information about you and the activity you engaged in, for example: your name and contact information; your order details; information that you voluntarily provide to us; the nature of your communication; the purpose of the interaction, and the action we took in response to your inquiry or request.

1c. Information Collected Automatically
We also may collect and store certain information about you and your device(s) automatically when you access or use our Site and Services. This information may include:

Technical Information – We collect technical information associated with your activity on our Site and may include information related to your browser and operating system, IP address (the Internet address of your computer), unique device identifiers, personal and online identifiers, and other information such as your device type. We use such information for diagnostic and statistical purposes and to administer our Services.
Site Usage Information – We collect information to better understand customer traffic patterns and Site usage. This may include the webpage that you were visiting before accessing our Site or mobile application, the pages or features of our Site or mobile application you browsed to inform us which part of our Site, app and Services you visit and how much time you spend there. This information is used to analyze and improve our Site and to provide our customers with a better user experience.
Site Preferences – We collect information about your preferences to make your use of the Site more productive using cookies.
1d. Location Information
When you use the Services, we may collect and store general location information (such as IP address). We may also collect route information and delivery pick-up or drop-off information. If you permit the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating system (“Platform”) or browser, we may also collect and store the precise location of your device when the Clocare app is running in the foreground or background of your device. This information may be used to help you select your delivery address, to provide more accurate deliveries of your orders, to provide recommendations to you, and to enhance your user experience and improve the services. You can choose whether to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on your device or Platform or when prompted by the Clocare mobile app. If you choose to disable the location feature, the delivery partner will not receive precise location information from your device, which may compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in a large area, such as a park.

1e. Information Related to the Referral Program or Gift Option
Clocare allows users to send gifts using the Services and invite friends and family to sign up for our Services. Sometimes we offer a promotional value for every friend or family member who signs up and places an order through your referral link. To help you do this, we may request you to grant us access to your mobile device address book. You can then direct us to send referral emails to contacts you select in your address book. By sending a referral or gift, you also consent to Clocare sending your public profile image to the contacts you select to receive a referral link. By choosing to invite a friend you represent that you have received the friend’s consent to provide his or her name, mailing address, email address or other information with us. Clocare will use that information to send the requested email or an email inviting him or her to visit the site and will store that information to track the success of the referral program and may send marketing emails. You can also send an SMS with a referral link to your contacts. If you use this option, you understand that Clocare does not control the timing, content, or recipients of these SMS messages.

Users may not send, publish, or share any false, misleading, or deceptive communications in connection with participation in the Referral Program. Such actions may violate various applicable laws. Clocare users may not send any referral emails, SMS messages, or other communications to children under the age of 13.

If you are referred to Clocare through one of our referral programs, or if someone attempts to refer you, we may share your name, whether you have already signed up for Clocare, whether you are a new customer, and whether you have placed a qualifying order with Clocare with the person(s) who referred you.

1f. Personal Information from Publicly Available Sources and Third Parties
We may collect Personal Information about you from publicly available sources, social network providers, marketing partners, and/or third parties. This may include:

Social Network Information – We may receive information about you from other services. For example, we receive certain information from Facebook when you use their service to login to Clocare.
Demographic Information – This characteristic information could include information such as income, marital status, spending habits, and other information."""

      "des":
          """We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies to collect information and personalize your experience with our Services.

2a. Cookies
Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain information.

How We Use Cookies– We use first-party, and third-party cookies for the following purposes:

To make our Services function properly;
To improve our Services;
To recognize you when you return to our Site and to remember information you have already provided, such as items already in your order cart;
To collect information about your activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests; and
To provide a secure browsing experience during your use of our Services.
How to Manage Cookies – You may disable the use of cookies by modifying your browser settings. If you choose to disable cookies you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our Services. For more information on cookies and how to disable cookies visit www.ftc.gov/ftc/cookies.shtm or https://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml.

2b. Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Site to deliver or communicate with cookies, in order to track and measure the performance of our Site and Services, monitor how many web visitors we have, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on webpages (or in an email).

2c. Online Analytics and Advertising Technologies
We and our third-party vendors may use automated technologies (including cookie identifiers on our Site), along with other collected information, to tailor ads or deliver content when you are on our Services or on other devices, apps or websites.

2d. Targeted Advertising
We (or our service providers) may use the information we collect, for instance, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers, to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers), or work with providers that do this, in order to better tailor content and features and provide you with a seamless experience across devices. If you wish to opt out of such cross-device tracking for purposes of interest-based advertising, you may do so through your device settings. We may also use cross-device tracking to help identify our users and serve advertising. This type of advertising is often called “interest-based” or “personalized” advertising—and when it occurs on mobile apps, “cross-app” advertising.

You can learn more about interest-based advertising and how to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising by visiting (i) the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.

Please note that even if you opt-out, you may still receive advertisements from us. However, in that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.

2e. Mobile Applications
Depending on your permissions, we may receive your Personal Information from your Internet service and mobile device providers. Users of mobile devices who do not want to receive interest-based advertising may opt-out in several ways. Learn more about your choices for mobile devices by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices. Each operating system, (iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices) provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You should view your device or system “Settings” to determine how you can opt out of use of your device ID for “cross-app” personalized advertising."""

3a. To Provide You with the Services
We use your information to provide you the Services. For example, we use credit card information to complete a transaction or an address to allow the service partner to fulfill your delivery (if you are a User), or your name and phone number to set up your business on the Services (if you are a Merchant). We may use your biometric information from your government-issued photo identification to verify your identity for the purpose of ordering or delivering an age-restricted order, or to confirm your identity in a support call. If the applicable information is to be provided or Service is to be performed by a third party, then we will disclose the applicable Personal Information to the third party providing the information for performing the applicable Services. Your information may be available or provided to third-party or service providers that are contractually obligated to protect your information as disclosed in this Policy. Payment information may be shared with your bank to validate your payment card.

3b. To Maintain, Improve, and Personalize the Services
We use your information for our everyday business operations such as auditing, administration of the Services, forum management, fulfilment, and analytics. Your information may also be used to improve the content and/or functionality of the Services. We may use your information to help us enhance offerings for Clocare and our Merchants, which may include improving marketing efforts for our large order delivering service, Clocare Drive. We also use your information to personalize your experience. For example, we may personalize the content and features you see when visiting our Services. In addition, we may personalize advertisements, marketing communications, and recommendations to make them more tailored to your interests.

3c. To Communicate with You
We use your information to communicate with you. For example, we may send you text messages, emails or other notifications about the status of your orders and deliveries. We may also contact you with promotional offerings or other communications that may be of interest to you. If we send you marketing emails about services that may interest you, each email will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing or other communications.

In the event you contact us, we use certain information to respond to your questions and assist you with any issues that may arise in your use of the Services. If you send direct messages, such as chat or text messages to a service partner, using the telephone number for that delivery person available on the Services, we may use a third-party service provider to monitor these messages. We monitor these messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate charging of fees, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, and for quality and training purposes. As part of this process, Clocare and its service provider will receive in real time and store data about your direct messages, such as chat or text messages, including the date and time of the text message, your phone number, and the message. If you do not agree with the monitoring of direct messages you send to our service partners, please do not send messages to our service partners.

3d. For Account and Network Security Purposes
We care about keeping you secure and safe while using our Services. Keeping you safe requires us to process your Personal Information, such as your device information, activity information and other relevant information. We use such information to combat spam, malware, malicious activities, or security risks; improve and enforce our security measures; and to monitor and verify your identity so that unauthorized users do not gain access to your information.

3e. To Maintain Legal and Regulatory Compliance
Our Services are subject to certain laws and regulations which may require us to process your Personal Information. For example, we process your Personal Information to pay our taxes, to fulfil our business obligations, ensure compliance with employment and recruitment laws or as necessary to manage risk as required under applicable law.

3f. To Enforce Compliance with Our Terms and Conditions and Policies
When you access or use our Services, you are bound to our Terms and Conditions (if you are a User), the Merchant Terms of Service or other master services agreement entered between you and Clocare (if you are a Merchant), and this Policy. To ensure you comply with them, we process your Personal Information by actively monitoring, investigating, preventing, and mitigating any alleged or actual prohibited, illicit, or illegal activities on our Services. We also process your Personal Information to investigate, prevent or mitigate violations of our internal terms, agreements, or policies; enforce our agreements with third parties and business partners.

3g. To Protect You, Others, and Our Business
We use your information to protect you, others, and our business, including, without limitation, using information for fraud prevention, for enforcement of our Terms of Service, to comply with the law, and to protect against security risks.
